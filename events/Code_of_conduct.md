# Code (& Supply) of Conduct

Code & Supply is committed to creating an environment where all of our guests
feel comfortable, safe and welcome to enjoy the events we organize. We will
work proactively to create this environment and, as such, all guests of Code &
Supply events are expected to act in a manner that is respectful to our desires
to create this environment and to those around them.

## Welcoming environment

Code & Supply is dedicated to proving a harassment-free environment for its volunteers, attendees, users, and members of the general public. All forms of harassment relating to, but not limited to age, race, gender, sexuality, appearance, disability, education, skill level, life situation, etc., are forbidden and will not be tolerated under any circumstances.

All volunteers, attendees, users, and members are required to treat each other with professional respect. Code & Supply does not tolerate any kind of disrespectful behavior including, but not limited to direct or indirect verbal harassment, physical harassment, inappropriate gestures, intimidation, stalking, belittling, or any kind of behavior that may make a member feel unwelcome in the organization.

These expectations are the same for virtual events as they are for in-person events.

## Respect for hosts and sponsors

As Code & Supply does not itself own or maintain facilities, all events are held in spaces generously offered by sponsors or other entities of the local technology community. Attendees to Code & Supply events are expected to adhere to any rules set forth by a hosting venue, such as limitations on where non-employees are allowed to be during the event. Code & Supply cannot be held responsible for attendee actions outside of the designated area for an event.

## Consequences

Those that do not comply with these rules may be prohibited from attending Code
& Supply events or barred from using its services.

## Changes

Code & Supply reserves the right to modify this document at any time at its discretion and without notice.
