https://youtu.be/zt2zGL7Npbs

## Drives People Away

- "neckbeard" image
- "math is hard"
- programming seems academic

## Unwelcoming

- title are intentionally academic sounding
- no women already there
- monoid jokes
- lack of support for beginners
- community members want to keep community solely experts

## People we want

- those who haven't programmed
- progammers learning new topics
- existing members
- previous members

## Things to be mindful of

### Program Material

- it's easy to forget what is hard to a beginner
- build on what the audience knows
  -- assess audience knowledge
- set small goals starting at the audience's starting knowledge
  -- wins along the way
- use visuals to demonstrate results as much as possible
- unambiguous language
  -- simple language linter
  -- plain language linter
  -- unexplained jargon is bad
  -- explain every acronym or unfamiliar term
- for language agnostic topics, choose a simple language for demonstrations
  -- python/ruby
  -- elixir for functional programming
- tooling not designed for beginners. explain where errors and tools are.
- create beginner friendly content
- share resources beforehand
- build strong onboarding
- positive approach

### Safe Spaces

- Code of Conduct
- Inclusive language that doesn't make someone feel like an "other"
- allowing people to speak up to address problematic behavior

### Mentoring

- 

## Goals

- People leave feeling enriched
- People leave feeling curious to learn more
- People don't leave frustrated
- People don't leave bored
