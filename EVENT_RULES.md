# Rules for Holding C&S Events

In order to provide a consistently good experience for our guests, we require
that any event held under the Code & Supply banner follow these few rules.

- All events must be posted to Meetup by Justin
- Events start with the Code & Supply intro presentation found in the assets
  repo
- Signage created using the standard template
- At least one sign bearing the event name and C&S logo on the front of the
  host building, ideally signs at each turn
- No sales pitch events. All events must be entertaining on their face and
  not a sales pitch
