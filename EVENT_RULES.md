# Rules for Holding C&S Events

In order to provide a consistently good experience for our guests, we require
that any event held under the Code & Supply banner follow these few rules.

- C&S events need to play the slides from the website at the beginning of events

- Use static cling signs

- all C&S events have a code of conduct available on our website

- event titles should be approachable

- every six months, there should be an intro to each language labeled as a "Refresher" so that people interested in that language can have a place to jump in and start attending events

- For merging groups, we should cross post events for a few months, but continuously push people to the C&S meet up. Long term, cross posting causes issues. 

- Sub groups should still maintain its own Twitter account if it'd like to. Mailing list is cool too. Promoting a dedicated channel in the C&S slack would be really good to do. 

- there are 3 roles to fill for each event. Presented, Emcee, and Greeter. These can't be the same person because it means one of the roles would suffer. 

- No sales pitch events. All events must be entertaining on their face and not a sales pitch

- All events are subject to the [Code & Supply code of conduct](http://www.codeandsupply.co/code-of-conduct/)
