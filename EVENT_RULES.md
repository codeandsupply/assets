# Rules for Holding C&S Events

In order to provide a consistently good experience for our guests, we require
that any event held under the Code & Supply banner follow these few rules.

- All events must be posted to Meetup by Justin. Group leaders should email 
  Justin with events they'd like to hold.
- Events start with the [Code & Supply intro presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1s47uqhIDKbWsNU3jrjwBrhqSbVzqCfeEXSiw7_g17W4/edit?usp=sharing)
- Signage created using the [standard template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-fbuoF7z2YEnss0y1ahFe9BKjZ74VaMKMbGVrLoPVB4/edit?usp=sharing)
- At least one sign bearing the event name and C&S logo on the front of the
  host building, ideally signs at each turn
- No sales pitch events. All events must be entertaining on their face and
  not a sales pitch
- All events are subject to the [Code & Supply code of conduct](http://www.codeandsupply.co/code-of-conduct/)
