# Rules for Holding C&S Events

In order to provide a consistently good experience for our guests, we require
that any event held under the Code & Supply banner follow these few rules.

- Events start with the Code & Supply intro presentation found in the assets
  repo
- Signage created using the standard template
- At least a sign on the front of the host building, ideally signs at each turn
